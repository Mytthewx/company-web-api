## Authentication

As intended by the project, a method of Basic Authentication was used in the application. The user data are hardcoded in the **UserService.cs** class.
Additionally, swagger settings have been added to enable an authentication feature where you can enter a login and password. The method used to search for companies does not require authorization. The password and username are encoded in Base64.

Default name and password:
|  Username          |  Password |
|----------------|----------------|
|PumoxUser		|	PumoxPassword|
